# hello-world
First repository on GitHub learning the basics
This is the readme file. Insure that there is always clear documentation on all repositories, issues, and the like.

This is additional information that I added after branching this file. I really appreciate how version control gives stronger access to managing and sharing information! ~^,.,.^~
